It is meant as a successor to Kindle-Water which I have discontinued because it can potentially fry your device.

####More stuff you should read

* We now have an aospish lock screen because of the new launcher. In settings, set lock screen type to none and activate the SL lock screen in Smart Launcher prefs.
* Activate the moonshine icon pack in SL prefs because the default one is fugly.
* Apex launcher is removed in this version so back up your Apex desktop layout before the install and after the install download Apex from the play store and restore your layout if you don't like SL.ï»¿
